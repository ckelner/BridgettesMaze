# BridgettesMaze
Helping my little cousin with her Java class at University of Florida

## From Bridgette

> Basically, I need to make 3 different mazes (they're all the same right now for simplicity until I get the rest of the code running perfectly), let a user select what maze they want to use, and allow them to use it.
>
> Some of the problems I've been having:
> 1. "Enter a command" that asks the user which way to move, appears twice when it first appears
> 2. I'm not sure why the menu (that asks the user which maze they would like to do) won't appear again after the user wins or decides to quit
